/**
 *  Style Guide 
 *    Follows the same style guide as codeigniter.
 *    File Naming :  Class files must be named in a Ucfirst-like manner,
 *                          while any other file name (configurations, views, 
 *                          generic scripts, etc.) should be in all lowercase.
 *                          
 *                          example : 
 *                              Somelibrary.php
 *                              Some_library.php
 *                              applicationconfig.php
 *                              application_config.php
 *                          Furthermore, class file names should match the name 
 *                          of the class itself. For example, if you have a  class 
 *                          named Myclass, then its filename must be Myclass.php.
 *    
 *    Class and Method Naming : Class names should always start with an 
 *                          uppercase letter. Multiple words should be separated 
 *                          with an underscore, and not CamelCased.
 *
 *                          example :
 *                              class Super_class{
 *                                  ...
 *                              }
 *                          Class methods should be entirely lowercased and named 
 *                          to clearly indicate their function, preferably including a verb. 
 *                          Try to avoid overly long and verbose names. Multiple words should be separated 
 *                          with an underscore.
 *
 *                          example :
 *                              function get_file_properties()  
 *                             ie. descriptive, underscore separator, and all lowercase letters
 *    
 *    Variable Names :  Similar to those used for class methods.Variables should contain only 
 *                          lowercase letters, use underscore separators, and be reasonably named to 
 *                          indicate their purpose and contents. Very short, non-word variables should 
 *                          only be used as iterators in for() loops.
 *                          
 *                          example :
 *                              for ($j = 0; $j < 10; $j++)
 *                              $str
 *                              $group_id
 *
 *    Commenting : DocBlock style comments preceding class, method, and property declarations 
 *                          so they can be picked up by IDEs:
 *                          example : 
 *                              /**
 *                               *
 *                               * @package     Package Name
 *                               * @subpackage  Subpackage
 *                               * @category    Category
 *                               * @author      Author Name
 *                               * @link        http://example.com
 *                               *\/
 *                               class Super_class {
 *                           
 *                          Use single line comments within code, leaving a blank line between large 
 *                          comment blocks and code.
 *                              
 *    Constants  :  Constants follow the same guidelines as do variables, except constants should 
 *                          always be fully uppercase.    
 *
 * 
 *    TRUE, FALSE, and NULL:  should always be fully uppercase.
 *
 *    
 *    Code Indenting : Use Allman style indenting. With the exception of Class declarations, 
 *                          braces are always placed on a line by themselves, and indented at the same level 
 *                          as the control statement that “owns” them. 
 *    
 *    private Methods and variables:
 *                          example : 
 *                              private function _convert_text() 
 *                          
 *                          private functions should start with _ (underscore)
 *    
 *    Short Open Tags :  Always use full PHP opening tags, in case a server does not have 
 *                          short_open_tag enabled.
 *                          
 *    One Statement Per Line:
 *                          Never combine statements on one line.
 *
 *
 * use 
 * 
 * 			// --------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 			
 * 			between two functions inside a class
 *
 *
